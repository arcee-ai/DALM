## Reading comprehension Pipeline

This is an example of how to string together an end to end reaading-comprehension dataset generator and training regiment in one go

It should be noted that this not the last say, if you the user think there's a better of stringing these together, the components
are atomic enough for you to string them in other ways that you may deem more appropriate

```bash
python dalm/pipelines/reading_comprehension_pipeline.py --model_name HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha \
    --input input.csv --csv_column text \
	--output_dataset_name combined \
    --general_spm_path tokenizers/general.spm \
	--llm_synth_model_name meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf \
    --llm_synth_model_context_length 4096

```
