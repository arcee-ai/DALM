# üêã Humback

An **unofficial** implementation of [Self-Alignment with Instruction Backtranslation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06259.pdf) .

The proposed Humback is a novel framework that can augment the instruction data for supervised fine-tuning with high quality.

üöß Currently, this repo is under construction and not finished.

## üå¥ Dependencies

- Dependencies required for training are included in requirements_train.txt
    - These dependencies are needed when running:
        - `train_backward_Myx.sh`
        - `train_seed.sh`
- Dependencies required for prediction are included in requirements_predict.txt
    - These dependencies are needed when running:
        - `self_aug.sh`
        - `self_curation.sh`
- Create two separate conda environments for training and predicting. This is because vllm downgrades some of the libraries needed for training (e.g. torch).

## üöÄ QuickStart

Procedure (2 iters):
1. Prepare seed data and unlabelled data.
2. Train the backward model $M_{yx}$ on the reversed seed data.
3. Self-augment the seed data via $M_{yx}$.
4. Train a forward model $M_{0}$ on the seed data.
5. Self-curate the unlabelled data $A_{k}^{(1)}$ via $M_{0}$ (tag quality scores).
6. Train a forward model $M_{1}$ on the self-curated unlabelled data $A_{k}^{(1)}$.
7. Use $M_{1}$ to self-curate the unlabelled data $A_{k}^{(2)}$.
8. Train a forward model $M_{2}$ on the self-curated unlabelled data $A_{k}^{(2)}$.

### Seed Data Pre-processing

We follow the original paper and use [oasst1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAssistant/oasst1) to construct the seed data.

The processed data could be found [here](https://github.com/Spico197/Humback/releases/tag/data) .

```bash
$ bash data/seed/download.sh
$ python data/seed/convert.py
# #data: 3286, #dump: 3200
# Instruction len: 149¬±266, Response len: 1184¬±799
```

### Unlabelled Data Pre-processing

Since ClueWeb22 is not a free open-source dataset, we sample texts from [falcon-refinedweb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb) instead.

The processed data could be found [here](https://github.com/Spico197/Humback/releases/tag/data) .

```bash
$ python data/unlabelled/falcon_refinedweb.py
```

### Train Seed Model $M_{0}$

Hyper parameters are the same as $M_{yx}$.

### Train Models $M_{i}$

Most hyper parameters are the same as $M_{yx}$ except for the number of steps (the original Humback trains 1600 steps on 512k samples).

```bash
# change the `--data_path` in `scripts/train_seed.sh`
$ bash scripts/train_seed.sh
```

The results and the trend are not as good as the original paper, but the performance of $M_{0}$ is better than vanilla llama2-7b.
Specifically, Humback $M_{1}$ is worse than $M_{0}$, and the different system prompts seem not be helpful on these benchmarks.
By the way, although $M_{0}$ is good at these benchmarks, it may be not good at generating high quality and diversified responses on more tasks.
Further experiments should be conducted to verify the effectiveness of the reproduced Humback $M_{0}$ (e.g. [alpaca_eval](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval) with GPT4 as the judge).

Possible reasons are:
1. The backward model $M_{yx}$ is not good enough to generate high quality instructions.
2. The seed model $M_{0}$ is not competent to evaluate the generated quality (not all scores are ranging from 1 to 5).

Since I don't have GPT4 API keys, `chatgpt_fn` is used as the evaluator here (as introduced in [alpaca_eval](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval)):

## üìù TODO

- [ ] train more steps on $M_{i}$.
- [ ] remove system prompts when training $M_{0}$, $M_{i}$ and $M_{yx}$.
