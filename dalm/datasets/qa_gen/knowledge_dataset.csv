Title,Abstract
New Zealand,"New Zealand is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It consists of two main landmasses—the North Island and the South Island—and more than 700 smaller islands. New Zealand is situated about 2,000 kilometers southeast of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometers south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. The country's varied topography and sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to tectonic uplift and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand is known for its distinct biodiversity, being home to unique species like the kiwi bird, which is native only to the country. The capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. New Zealand has a parliamentary system of government and is a constitutional monarchy. It was one of the last major landmasses settled by humans, and its Polynesian ancestors are believed to have arrived in the 13th century, forming the Māori culture. Today, New Zealand is a highly developed country with a high-income economy and ranks highly in various global performance indicators, including quality of life and education."
